# Problems that are solved by the developed application:

1. Tracking water intake: The app helps users keep track of how much water they
   drink each day. This way, users can see if they're drinking enough water and
   stay hydrated.

2. Personalized accounts: Users can make their own accounts, so they can keep
   their water intake private and get recommendations tailored to them, like how
   much water they should drink based on their gender.

3. Calculating water norma: The app figures out how much water each user should
   aim to drink daily, making it easier to stay hydrated.

4. Managing data: Users can easily add, edit, and delete their water intake
   info. This makes it simple to track progress and adjust goals.
